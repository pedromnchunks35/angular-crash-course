# angular-crash-course
Just a crash course to put my hands on angular. I know react so thats why i am doing a crash course.. because it should not be much different.

# Install
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- ng create (name app)

# Tip
- Download the angular extension for your browser
- It is very cool because it shows per component what is in the page
- We can even change stuff there which is cool

# Tip 2
- We can debug the app using to inspect of the Google Chrome : lol
